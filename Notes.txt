Understand and Review the date and then clean the data.

name - This is the name of the exo-planet.
--
light_years_from_earth - This is the distance of this planet from Earth in light years. 1 light year is the distance light can travel in one year, and light it super fast. It can travel 9.461 Trillion km in 1 year.
-- 
--planet_mass - This is the mass of the planet with respect to Earth or Jupiter (Jupiter is the metric for 
Gas Giants while Earth is the metric for all other types of planets). stellar_magnitude - This is the brightness of the host star of the planet when observed from Earth (just as the sun is our host star).
discovery_date - This is the year of discovery for the exo-planet. 
hyperlink - This is just the hyperlink that we scraped. 
planet_type - This is the type of the planet (Gas Giant, Super Earth, etc.)
temp_planet_date - This is a duplicate. temp_planet_mass - This is another duplicate. planet_radius - This is the radius of the exo-planet with respect to Earth or Jupiter. orbital_radius - This is the average distance of this exo-planet from its sun. Just like our solar system has 1 sun, there are multiple solar systems that contain many planets and sun(s). 
orbital_period - This is the time it takes to complete one orbit of itâ€™s sun. 
eccentricity - This denotes how circular the orbit is. It might be oval in shape too. The lower the eccentricity, the more circular is the orbit.
